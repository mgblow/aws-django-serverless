# Django AWS Lambda RESTful API

This is a Django project that demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Django and deploy it on AWS Lambda. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Django
- Zappa (for Lambda deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-django-serverless.git
   cd aws-django-serverless
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Copy .env.example file and fill it with the required credentials accordingly.


5. Apply DynamoDb table migrations, this script will create table for you using cli, remember to change the table name in this file:

   ```bash
   python migrator.py
   ```
6. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The project should now be running locally. You can access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/devices/.
